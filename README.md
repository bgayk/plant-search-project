## Usage

This page allows users to look up plant information, including scientific, common, and other names, watering and sunlight preferences and life cycles.  Users can narrow down plant search results based on the above, and also indoor/outdoor preferences, hardiness zone and edibility.  Plants can be added to the user's favorites (found in the upper left side of the interface) via client side storage. When clicked, that plant's information will be pulled for quick viewing. These can be cleared using the clear button that populates to the right.

The application also allows the user to determine their hardiness zone by simply clicking "Hardiness Helper!" and entering their zip code. Once submitted, their zone will appear following "Your Hardiness Zone:" under the referred to button.
